-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=pin-by-—ï–ΩŒ±√∏œâ--on-gacha-life-base-eyes-amp-hair--character-outfits>Pin By —ï–ΩŒ±‚àÇ√∏œâ üå∫ On ~Gacha Life Base, Eyes, & Hair~ | Character Outfits<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pin-by-—ï–ΩŒ±√∏œâ--on-gacha-life-base-eyes-amp-hair--character-outfits>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/be/33/07/be330795d27b2387486dc01d427dd83e.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.aR--90ovSsgEugI87nk5wgAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Pin by —ï–ΩŒ±‚àÇ√∏œâ üå∫ on ~Gacha Life Base, Eyes, & Hair~ | Character outfits"><p><em>Source: br.pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Different ways to style your wallpaper:
